### Beginner code for drawing a hexagon

The following program draws a hexagon using the Woopec library (see also this [article][hexafour-03]):

```csharp
using Woopec.Core;

internal class Program
{
    public static void WoopecMain()
    {
        var pen = Pen.CreateExample();
        pen.IsDown = true;

        pen.Rotate(60);
        pen.Move(100);
        pen.Rotate(60);
        pen.Move(100);
        pen.Rotate(60);
        pen.Move(100);
        pen.Rotate(60);
        pen.Move(100);
        pen.Rotate(60);
        pen.Move(100);
    }
}
```

The `Pen` class follows similar concepts as the`Turtle` class from this previous [article][hexafour-03]: 

* First, a simple pen is created.
* If the pen should draw during its movement, its `IsDown` property must be set to `true`.
* The Pen always draws in a certain direction. For changing this direction there is the method **`Rotate`**. A value greater than 0 rotates to the left (thus corresponding to `Turtle.Left`) and a value less than 0 rotates to the right (thus corresponding to `Turtle.Right`).
* The **`Move`** method changes the position of the pen. A positive value moves the pen forward, a negative value moves it backward.
* As an alternative to `Rotate` and `Move` you can also use the pen method `SetPosition` for drawing. But for now we stay with Rotate and Move

### Clean Code

The above code draws a hexagon. So it does exactly what it is supposed to do. But that is not the only criterion for good code. Code should also be easy to understand when you read it. And code should be easy to change. There is a book on this called "Clean Code.  A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin. It starts with this sentence:

> Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional. There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.

It talks about professionals here, but from my point of view, it applies just as much to beginners. You should write as clean code as possible from the beginning. This will help you to make much better progress.

Let's see how we can write the above code more cleanly. At the same time we will learn some new C# constructs.

### Variables

What would we have to do if we wanted the edges in our program to be only 50 pixels long instead of 100 pixels?

We would have to replace the `100` with a `50` in six places. This is quite cumbersome. It is much easier if we define and use a **C# variable**. We can define a variable like this:

```csharp
    var edgeLength = 50;
```

The **`var` keyword** tells the C# compiler that a variable should be defined here. The text `edgeLength` is the **variable name**, here we can think of any name we want. But the name may only consist of letters, numbers and a few special characters (e.g. a `_`), spaces are not allowed. After the equal sign there follows the value of the variable, here `50`. This variable can now be used wherever the edge length is needed. The relevant part of the program then looks like this:

```csharp
    var edgeLength = 50;

    pen.Rotate(60);
    pen.Move(edgeLength);
    pen.Rotate(60);
    pen.Move(edgeLength);
    pen.Rotate(60);
    // ...
```

### Coding-Conventions

In principle you can name a variable as you like. However, programming is easier if you follow a few rules, so-called **Coding Conventions**. For the names of variables there are these conventions:

* It should be recognizable from the name what it is about. Therefore the name `edgeLength` is better than a name that consists of only one letter (`e`, for example).
* Variable names start with a lowercase letter. This makes it easier to distinguish variables from other things.
* If the name consists of several words, the other words each start with a capital letter. This spelling is also called *camelCase*.

Further information about naming conventions can be found for example at [Wikipedia][WikiNamingConventions] or at [Microsoft][MsNamingConventions].

### The DRY-Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

In our hexagon program, these lines are repeated six times:

```csharp
    pen.Rotate(60);
    pen.Move(edgeLength);
```

This is bad for several reasons: if we want to change something, for example replace `100` with `edgeLength`, we have to change it in several places. This is superfluous work. And if we forget one place when changing, our program will not work as it should.

So we should change our program in a way that we don''t have to repeat ourselves in the code. 

For this we need...

### Loops

For doing the same thing multiple times, C# has loops. For example, we can change our program to use a **while loop**:

```csharp
    var edgeCounter = 0;
    while (edgeCounter < 6)
    {
        pen.Rotate(60);
        pen.Move(edgeLength);
        edgeCounter = edgeCounter + 1;
    }
```

Here we have used several C# constructs:

* First we define a new variable `edgeCounter`. With this variable we count how many edges have already been painted. 

* Whenever we have drawn an edge, we increase the value of `edgeCounter` by adding one. It works like this:
      `edgeCounter = edgeCounter + 1;` 

* We have to repeat this as long as we have drawn less than six edges. We specify it like this:
      `while (edgeCounter < 6)`
  The character `<` stands for `is less than`. So by `edgeCounter < 6` we check if the value of the variable `edgeCounter` is smaller than `6`.
* This is followed by an opening curly bracket `{` and further down by a closing bracket `}`.  These two brackets define a so-called **code block**. All lines of code between these two brackets belong to this code block and will be executed multiple times.

* To be able to recognize where the code block starts and where it ends, the brackets are written in separate lines and the content of the code block is indented by four characters (you can also press the Tab key). We do this kind of **code indentation** uniformly throughout the code so that we can easily recognize code blocks everywhere. This is also a coding convention.

Loops can be written even more compactly as **for-loop**:

```csharp
    for (var edgeCounter = 0; edgeCounter < 6;  edgeCounter++)
    {
        pen.Rotate(60);
        pen.Move(edgeLength);
    }
```

The `for` loop uses the same elements as the while loop, but here they are on a single line: First the `edgeCounter` variable is defined, then a semicolon follows, then a condition specifies how often the loop should be executed, then another semicolon follows, and at the end there is the statement to increment the variable by one. 

Because it often happens that you want to increment a variable by one, there is also a special statement for this. Instead of `edgeCounter = edgeCounter + 1` you can simply write `edgeCounter++`.

There are also other forms of loops. And there are also many other possibilities when defining conditions. I don't explain this in more detail here, because there is a good explanation page from Microsoft. You should have a look at all the examples on this page and try them out:   [C# `if` statements and loops - conditional logic tutorial][MSDocsLoops].

### DRY principle, part 2: Simplifying the code even further

Our code is much cleaner now. But it does not yet follow the DRY principle one hundred percent.

Where does the number `60` in `seymour.Rigth(60)` come from? This number has to do with the number of edges: Because we want to draw a regular 6-corner, the pen must rotate by `360.0 / 6` degrees. So actually the number `6` appears twice: Once in the for condition (`edgeCounter < 6`). And a second time in the calculation of the rotation (`360 / 6`). We can also improve this: We define and use a variable `numberOfEdges` that specifies the desired number of edges. Then we can change our program like this:

```csharp
public static void WoopecMain()
{
    var pen = Pen.CreateExample();
    pen.IsDown = true;

    var edgeLength = 50;
    var numberOfEdges = 6;

    for (var edgeCounter = 0; edgeCounter < numberOfEdges; edgeCounter++)
    {
        pen.Rotate(360.0 / numberOfEdges);
        pen.Move(edgeLength);
    }
}
```

Compared to the initial version, the code has become shorter, there are no repetitions, and the variable names explain the meaning of values. All in all, the code is much easier to understand.

There is another advantage: What would we have had to change in the initial code if we had wanted to draw a 17-corner? We would have had to add many more statements, and we would have had to replace the number 60 with another number. In the current version of the code, we only need to change one place. We change the definition of numberOfEdges to 17:
```csharp
    var numberOfEdges = 17;
```
This single change causes the code to draw a 17-corner instead of a 6-corner.

From this example, you can see how important it is to write clean code.

### Debugging von Variablen

When using variables, errors can happen. But also here the debugger helps. If you put the cursor on the check `edgeCounter < numberOfEdges` in the code above, you can create a breakpoint there with F9 (see [previous article][hexafour-04]). When you then start the program in the debugger (with F5), it stops at this breakpoint. You can then see in the debugger what values the variables have:

![](/assets/images/hexafour/VSBreakpointWithWatchWindow.png)

Below the code window, Visual Studio displays an Autos window. This window displays the values of the variables that are currently playing a role. You can see in this example that `edgeCounter` has the value 0 and `numberOfEdges` has the value 6. You can then run the code step by step (with F10) or until the next breakpoint (with F5) and always see the current value of the variable.

The debugger has many more features for variables. For example, moving the mouse cursor over a variable in the code will automatically display its value. You can find more information about debugging variables in the [Microsoft documentation][MSDocsInspectVariables].

### Kurze Zusammenfassung

* *Variablen* definieren (`var edgeCounter = 0`), √§ndern (`edgeCounter = edgeCounter + 1;`), pr√ºfen (`edgeCounter < 6`), verwenden (`Right(360-0 / edgeNumber`).
* *Schleifen* (`for`  oder `while`) benutzen. Es gibt weitere M√∂glichkeiten, siehe [Microsoft Tutorial][MSDocsLoops]
* *Bedingungen* definieren, z. B. `(edgeCounter < 6)`, Es gibt aber noch viel mehr M√∂glichkeiten, siehe  [Microsoft Tutorial][MSDocsLoops]
* *Coding Conventions* f√ºr Variablen-Namen und f√ºr Einr√ºckung im Code benutzen. Siehe dazu auch [Microsoft Naming Conventions][MsNamingConventions]
* M√∂glichst das *DRY-Prinzip* nutzen.

### √úbung

Beispielsweise k√∂nntest du folgendes versuchen: √Ñndere den Code so, dass er statt einer `for`-Schleife wieder eine `while`-Schleife benutzt. Dann √§ndere den Code so, dass in jedem Schleifendurchlauf die Kantenl√§nge (`edgeLength`) um eins verringert wird. Und dann √§ndere die Bedingung f√ºr die Schleife so, dass die Schleife erst dann beendet wird, wenn die edgeLength den Wert 1 hat. Was ist das Ergebnis?
