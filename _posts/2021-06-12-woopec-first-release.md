As of today, the first version of the Woopec library is available on NuGet.

<!--more-->

My goal is to write a library that even beginners can use to write graphical programs in C#. The current version is a first step: The core functions of the Turtle class, which is also known from python, are available. Many functions from python turtle are still missing, and I can think of many other features: bitmap mode, bezier curves, .NET MAUI, multi-threading, open data, â€¦

But now summer is coming and I want to wait and see whether anyone can do anything with this library and whether it is worth continuing.

All further information can (hopefully) be found on this website.

I am happy about everyone who tries it out and gives me [feedback]({% link contact.md %}).
