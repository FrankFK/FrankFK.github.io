## About me

When I was born in the mid-60s, no one had a computer at home. Things have changed in the early 80s and I was able to buy my first computer: a Sinclair ZX Spectrum with 16kB. A few years later I started to study computer science. I had the opportunity to combine it with studying philosophy. After graduating, I spent a few years at a research institute developing programs for the physical design of computer chips (including IBM's Deep Blue). Then I changed to a software company. Here I first worked as a software developer, then as a team leader and scrum master. Now I work as a software architect.

I live with my family in North Rhine – Westphalia in Germany.
