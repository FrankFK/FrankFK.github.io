## About me

When I was born in the mid-60s, no one had a computer at home. Things have changed in the early 80s and I was able to buy my first computer: a Sinclair ZX Spectrum with 16kB. 
A few years later I started to study computer science. I had the opportunity to combine it with studying philosophy. After getting my diploma I worked a few interesting years 
at a research institute. Then I changed to a software company. Here I am working as a software architect.

I live with my two sons and my wife in North Rhine – Westphalia in Germany.
