Sometimes I worry about software development or I look for solutions to C# problems. 
If I come up with anything useful, I'll post it in my **[Blog](/blog.html)**.

Otherwise, I continue to develop the [Woopec library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Woopec.wpf).
This is a C# library that makes it easy (hopefully) for novice software developers to get started with C# and graphics.
If there's anything new, I'll document it  in **[Woopec Docs](/woopec-docs-index.html)**.
